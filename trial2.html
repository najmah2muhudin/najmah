        <h2>things i admire the most about her</h2>
        <p>she is a young muslim youtuber who accomplished most of her life goals<br>
            she inspires me the most because she is living her life to the fullest<br>
            despite of the ideology that a woman should be under a man to succeed she has achieved everything without a male figure in her life
